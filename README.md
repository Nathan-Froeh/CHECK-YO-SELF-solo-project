# CHECK-YO-SELF-solo-project

##By Nathan Froehlich

###Summary
Check Yo' Self is my final project of Mod-1 for Turing School of Software and Design.
A month and a half ago I didn't know what JavaSript was, throughout the Mod I learned about the basics of HTML, CSS, and Vanilla JS along with how to integrate all of this with LocalStorage and OOP. Check Yo' Self was put together for us to prove what we have learned since through the first Mod and further solidify our understanding. The greatest thing I learned in the 5 days building this project is the value of really planning out a project on day one before just diving in breaking everything. Planning out the wireframes while naming everything from classes to functions helped me keep the code in a great order while I was building it and cut down on a ton of time refactoring and I found that I could put all the code together significantly faster than I had on all previous projects. It was a ton of fun knowing exactly what I had to do through nearly the whole project and really being able to push myself to think about the best way to do something in place of how to just scrape by. All the past projects have been in a group setting where I did most of the JS and the rest of the team tackled most of the CSS and MdeiaQueries so it was nice to do all of the CSS and get my first taste making a mobile responsive app.
My greatest struggle was to make the delete button on each card only clickable when all items have been checked off each respective card and making it persist on page load. Getting the correct information was the real tricky part until I learned about the node list.
My greatest win was really feeling like I crushed this project without much help other than a few google searches.
